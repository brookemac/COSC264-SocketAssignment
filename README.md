# COSC264-SocketAssignment
This is a Socket Assignment given to me in my COSC264 - Computer Networks and the Internet course at the University of Canterbury. 
I created two programs written in Python, a client and server, which asks for the current time of day or current date. 
The server then provides the information in 3 available languages.
